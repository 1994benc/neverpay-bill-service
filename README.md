## Run the application in the development environment
1. If you wish to use VSCode devcontainer, install [the plug in first](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container). Make sure you have Docker installed and running.
2. Re-open the project inside a devcontainer (if you open the project in VSCode with devcontainer plugin installed, you should see a pop-up asking you to open the project inside a devcontainer)
3. You should be able to run the server with the following command
``` 
go run cmd/server/main.go 
```
